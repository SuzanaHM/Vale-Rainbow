The completion of deletion will only occur after the administrator's release, ensuring a careful review before any action is taken. This measure aims to maintain a transparent and fair process in compliance with our guidelines.</p>
    <p>9.3. On our platform, we prioritize the safety and integrity of our community. In situations involving criminal activities, it is imperative for users to act responsibly and ethically. If there is any suspicion or knowledge of illegal practices, we encourage users to report directly to the relevant law enforcement authorities. Additionally, we reserve the right to retain conversation records related to such incidents to fully collaborate with investigations. In accordance with our security policy, the account associated with criminal behavior will be immediately suspended during the investigation period. These measures aim to maintain a safe and reliable environment for all users, promoting cooperation and law compliance.</p>
    <p>9.4. The term "content retained" refers to situations where, due to user reports or administrative decision, certain content is not deleted immediately. Instead, it remains in the database, being temporarily hidden from users. During this period, a message such as "Retained for analysis" or "Deleted" may be displayed. Permanent removal will only occur upon legal or administrative decision, with legislation superior to the administrator's decision. This measure aims to ensure a careful and fair analysis before taking permanent actions regarding the content in question.</p>
