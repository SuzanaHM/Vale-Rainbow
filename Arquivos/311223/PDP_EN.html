    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Suzana Martins built the Vale Rainbow app as an ad-supported app. This SERVICE is provided by Suzana Martins free of charge and is intended to be used as is.</p>

    <h1>
        Service Providers
    </h1>

    <p>
        I may hire third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform services related to the Service; or</li>
        <li>To help us analyze how our Service is used.</li>
        <li>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to carry out the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obliged not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Security</h1>

    <p>
        We value your trust in providing us with your personal information, so we are striving to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h1>Links to other sites</h1>

    <p>
        This Service may contain links to other websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that website. Please note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.
    </p>

    <h1>Children's privacy</h1>

    <p>This service is not directed to individuals under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children in that age group. If we identify that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verifiable parental or guardian consent, we will take immediate action to delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, we ask that you contact us at vrainbow.contato@gmail.com so that we can take necessary action. Commitment to children's privacy is a priority and an integral part of our ethical responsibility.</p>

    <h1>Content and data retention</h1>

    <p>This service takes a careful approach to data retention as outlined in its contractual clauses. In case of "Permanent Ban" (Clause 4.2), only the email and IP address of the banned user are retained to prevent future use, while all other data is deleted. "Account Deletion" (Clause 4.3) allows users to request complete removal of their data, carried out within 14 days, unless there are legal reasons or a permanent ban.</p>
    <p>In "Content Retention" (Clause 9), reported content is temporarily retained for analysis (9.1), ensuring compliance with guidelines. Deletion occurs after review by an administrator (9.2). In cases of criminal activity (9.3), conversation records are retained for collaboration in investigations, with immediate suspension of accounts associated with criminal behavior. The definition of "retained content" (9.4) highlights definitive removal only after legal or administrative decision, ensuring careful analysis. These practices aim to maintain a safe, transparent environment and in compliance with privacy laws and policies.</p>

    <h1>Legal measures</h1>

    <p>This service, committed to the security and integrity of the community, reserves the right to share data with government authorities in cases of criminal activities, as stipulated in clause 9.3 of the terms and conditions. In situations involving illegal practices, the platform encourages users to report directly to the competent police authorities. In such cases, the account associated with the criminal behavior will be immediately suspended for the duration of the investigation, and records of pertinent conversations may be retained to fully assist the investigation. This measure aims to ensure compliance with the law, promoting a safe environment for all users and demonstrating the service's commitment to ethical responsibility in critical legal situations.</p>

    <h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <p>This policy is effective from 01/01/2024</p>
