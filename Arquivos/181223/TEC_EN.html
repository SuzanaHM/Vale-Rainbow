    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

    <p>By downloading or using the application, these terms will automatically apply to you – so make sure you read them carefully before using the application. You are not allowed to copy or modify the application, any part of the application, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the application's source code, and you should also not try to translate the application into other languages or create derivative versions. The application itself, and all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Suzana Martins.</p>

    <p>Suzana Martins is committed to ensuring that the application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the application or its services without making it very clear exactly what you are paying for.</p>

    <p>The Vale Rainbow app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide my Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the application secure. Therefore, we recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. This could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise the security features of your phone, and it may mean that the Vale Rainbow app will not work properly or at all.</p>

    <p>The app uses third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <p>Link to the Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Services (<a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Services</a>)</li>
        <li>AdMob (<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">AdMob</a>)</li>
        <li>Google Analytics for Firebase (<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/">Google Analytics for Firebase</a>)</li>
        <li>Firebase Crashlytics (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things for which Suzana Martins will not take responsibility. Certain functions of the application will require the application to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Suzana Martins cannot take responsibility for the application not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>

    <p>If you're using the application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the application or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the application, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the application.</p>

    <p>Similarly, Suzana Martins cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the application, i.e., you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service, Suzana Martins cannot accept responsibility.</p>

    <p>As for responsibility for your use of the application, when you're using the application, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Suzana Martins will not be responsible for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the application.</p>

    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the application. The application is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the application. Suzana Martins does not promise that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the application and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the application, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

    <h3>Changes to these Terms and Conditions</h3>

    <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

    <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 12-18-2023.</p>
