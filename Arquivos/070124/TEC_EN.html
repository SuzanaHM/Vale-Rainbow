        <li><strong>Age Restriction: Participation in the application is only permitted for users aged 13 years and over. We emphasize that, in case of non-compliance with this rule by the user, the application does not assume any responsibility, as it does not have the means to individually monitor each user. Supervising the activities of children under 13 is the sole responsibility of parents or legal guardians, and it is crucial that they are aware of and monitor their children's online activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual Content: Posts that address sexual themes, as long as they are not explicit, are allowed as part of the emotional support offered by the community. However, it is imperative to remain respectful and sensitive when sharing these experiences.

Violations of this rule will result in immediate disciplinary action.</li>
        <li><strong>Minors: Minors (13 to 17 years old) are permitted on the app, and we make every effort to monitor content posted by other users. However, it is essential to highlight that supervision of minors is the responsibility of parents and guardians. By using the application, it is automatically agreed that the person responsible is aware of the possible dangers, exempting the application and its team from any responsibility related to unwanted content.</li>
        <li><strong>Bullying and Harassment Conduct: Any form of bullying, harassment, threats, stalking or intimidating behavior towards other users is strictly prohibited. Violations will result in disciplinary action.</li>
        <li><strong>Inappropriate Use of Copyrighted Content: It is strictly prohibited to share, distribute or use any copyrighted content without due authorization from the rights holder. Users are encouraged to respect and follow all copyright laws. Violations of this rule will result in disciplinary action, including immediate removal of content and, if necessary, legal action.</li>
        <li><strong>Dissemination of False Information: The dissemination of false or misleading information is prohibited. Users who disseminate incorrect information will be subject to disciplinary action.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for Legal Regulations:</strong><br>Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the application. Violations may result in disciplinary action and notification to appropriate authorities when necessary.</li>

        <li><strong>Unrelated Political Content:</strong><br>We ask users to avoid sharing political content that is not directly related to the purpose of the platform.

        <li><strong>Religious Conversions:</strong><br>We respect the diversity of beliefs and opinions in our community. Any attempt to convert or persuade other users to adopt a specific religion is strictly prohibited. We encourage respect for different religious perspectives. Violations of this rule result will take disciplinary measures, aiming to maintain an inclusive and respectful environment for all members.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Clause 10 -->
    <h2>10. Content Retention:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Multiple Reports: Content that receives a pre-determined number of reports will be temporarily held for review. This measure is to ensure compliance with our guidelines and enable appropriate action if necessary. We appreciate community reports, which are essential to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for everyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Deleting content with pending reports: When deleting reported content, whether the main post or comments on posts, the content will be retained until reviewed by an administrator. Completion of the deletion will only occur after authorization from the administrator, ensuring careful evaluation before any action is taken. This measure aims to maintain a transparent and fair process in accordance with our guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Issues:</strong><br>On our platform, we prioritize the safety and integrity of our community. In situations involving criminal activities, it is imperative that users act responsibly and ethically. If there is any suspicion or knowledge of illegal practices, we encourage users to report it directly to the competent police authorities. Additionally, we reserve the right to retain records of conversations related to such incidents in order to fully cooperate with investigations. In accordance with our security policy, the account associated with the criminal behavior will be immediately suspended during the investigation period. These measures aim to maintain a safe and trustworthy environment for all users, promoting cooperation and compliance with the law.</li>
        <li><strong>Definition of Retained Content:</strong><br>The term "retained content" refers to situations in which, due to user reports or administrative decision, certain content is not immediately deleted. Instead, it remains in the database, temporarily hidden from users. During this time, a message such as "Hold for review" or "Deleted" may be displayed. Permanent removal will only occur through a legal or administrative decision, with legislation being superior to the administrator's decision. This measure aims to ensure careful and fair analysis before taking permanent action in relation to the content in question.</li>
    </ol>
